1. The attacker can obtain the IP address of the model user

2. The attacker can steal the local sensitive files from the model user

3. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the computer of the model user

4. The attacker can get the SHELL of the model user

For each of these 4 kinds of malicious Tensorflow models, we provide one folder with one PoC video and corresponding source code to reproduce.
